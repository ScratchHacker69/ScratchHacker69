- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ScratchHacker69
- I Hack Scratch Accounts
- Don't Ban Me
- This Is Only For Educational Purposes
- I Have Only Used My Bot To Hack My Own Account
- I Created This To Show Scratch How Easily You Can Hack Into People's Scratch Accounts Using Brute Force Hacking
- They Do Have A Recaptcha In Place If You Get The Password Wrong Too Many Times
- But I Have A Recaptcha Bot To Surrpass This System
- They Should Instead Send A Confirmation Email To The Actuall Account Owner Instead Or Something
