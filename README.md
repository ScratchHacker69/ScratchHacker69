- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ScratchHacker69
- I Hack Scratch Accounts
- Don't Ban Me
- This Is Only For Educational Purposes
- I Have Only Used My Bot To Hack My Own Account
- I Created This To Show Scratch How Easily You Can Hack Into People's Scratch Accounts Using Brute Force Hacking
- They Do Have A Recaptcha In Place If You Get The Password Wrong Too Many Times
- But I Have A Recaptcha Bot To Surrpass This System
- They Should Instead Send A Confirmation Email To The Actuall Account Owner Instead Or Something
- I Am Technically A Gray Hat Hacker
- A Gray Hat Hacker Is A White Hat Hacker That Hacks Without Permission
- A White Hat Hacker Is A Hacker Who Is Given Permission To Hack Into A System
- To Show The Security Flaws Of The System
- So The Company Can Improve In That Area
